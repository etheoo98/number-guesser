# number-guesser
C# console application made for a beginners programming course.

## Assignment description
### This assignment is (at least) about:
* Random numbers
* Integers
* Loop with *do* and *while*
* Conditions with *if* and *else*

The user must guess a random number. When the program starts, an appropriate text will be printed to the user and a secret number will be randomly drawn in the background. This number must be between 1 and 100, and this number must be stored in a variable.

Now a loop will be introduced and in that loop the user will be prompted to enter a number.

*If* the number is less than the secret random number, the user must be notified of this, and the same if the number is too large.

The loop will continue to reiterate until the user succeeds in entering the secret number. Then a suitable text must be printed.

Think about making a neat (textual) and clear program.

### Make it more difficult
Here are some suggestions on how you can make this assigment harder:
1. Keep track of how many times you had to guess before you correctly gussed the number and print this out.
2. If you are close to guessing the correct number, you may receive a text that says "You're close!" or something similar. This can be the case if you are a certain amount of numbers away from the secret number.
